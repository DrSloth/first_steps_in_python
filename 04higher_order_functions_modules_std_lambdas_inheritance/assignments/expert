Create a class called ListAsserter which is initialised with a list.
Add a function called assert_all to the class.
This function should take another function as parameter.
The function is used to assert something for every element in the stored list.
If the function returns False for an element in the list a ListAssertionException should be raised.

The ListAssertionException should be created by you and initialised with the element of the list.
ListAssertionException should set a custom message including the value for which the assertion failed.
