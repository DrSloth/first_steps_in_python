This extreme task requires a deeper understanding of objects which might require some research.
It also requires a new concept called closures.

Researching closures (and being able to explain them) is part of the task.

Rewrite the "advanced" task with simple prototype based inheritance.
This doesn't have to be in two modules.

What are the differences? Which would you prefer?
