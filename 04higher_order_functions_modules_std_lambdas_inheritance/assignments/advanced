Create two modules. 
The first module should contain a class called SuperList
which stores a list and is takes one list as parameter 
for its constructor.

The other file should include a class called ListMapper
which inherits from SuperList and adds a higher order map function.

This map function should return a dictionary where the keys are
the old values that point to the new values generated by calling
the function taken as parameter on the respective keys taken from the list
