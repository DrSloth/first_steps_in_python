# Functions are used to create small reusable parts of code.
# They are defined using the def keyword

# This is the function head
def fun():
    # This is called the function body. 
    # The function body is associated with the function fun because of the indentation
    print("Hello")

# Functions are called with parentheses. Calling a functions means that it is executed.
# You can think of it as jumping to the beginning of the function and then jumping back
fun()
print("World")
