Write a program which takes a list of numbers as command line arguments. 
Calculate the cubic root of each number, each in its own thread by brute force (just trying out).
Print that a calculation finished when it is finished.
Skip all numbers that don't have an integer cubic root (just write that its cubic root isn't real)
