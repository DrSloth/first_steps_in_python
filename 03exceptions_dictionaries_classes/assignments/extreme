This task is extreme because it doesn't tell you how to implement its main problem.
One main skill of programming is being able to know which data structures to use from 
an abstract context as well as creating/merging different ones.

Create a class called IndexMap. This class is should store keys and values as well as the order
in which keys are added. You should implement the following methods:
- insert: Insert a key and a value into the map
- get: Get a value by its key 
- get_index: Get an index (the number of elements that were added before it) by a key
- get_by_index: Get a value by its index

This class does not need to handle removal of value in any way
