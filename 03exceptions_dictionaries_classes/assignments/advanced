Write a class called "DictCreator" which is initialised with one list 
called "keys" as parameter.
Add a method to the class called "make_dict" which takes another list called 
'values' as parameter. Raise an exception (which makes sense in your opinion) 
if the length of both aren't equal. If the length of both are equal create a 
dictionary containing the value of keys as keys and the values of 'values' as 
the values of the dictionary. The first index of 'keys' should be the key of the first
value inside of 'values' and so on.
